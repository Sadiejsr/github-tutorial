Hello! Welcome to my research on aspen serpentine leafminer and burn severity in Northeastern BC.

# Overview

This repository offers an overview of the R and Python code required to compile open source data to assess variable importance in burn severity. I utilized data from the Vegetation Resource Index, BC's Aerial Overview Survey, and the National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System. 

# Collaborators

I would like to thank the UBC and MGEM community for their on-going support throughout this project. I would like to extend special thanks to the Dr. Allan Carroll, Dr. Kathleen Coupland, Dr. Paul Pickell, and the entire UBC Forest Insect Disturbance Ecology Lab.
